# Optical Character Recognition
Simple implementation of a `Keras` model for optical character recognition (OCR).

The project intends to propose a simple solution to expose through an API a system for One-Shot learning in the field of image recognition (OCR).


## Getting Started
You can start to explore the project by taking a look to the `notebooks/` folder where you'll find several `.ipynb` files containing all you need to train a model for OCR tasks. You'll also find an implementation of  `ArcFace` for `tensorflow`.
